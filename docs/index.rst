Welcome to Ebi Metagenomics documentation!
==========================================

Introduction

Metagenomics is the study of all genomes present in any given environment
without the need for prior individual identification or amplification. For
example, in its simplest form, a metagenomic study might be the direct
sequence results of DNA extracted from a bucket of sea water.

The EBI Metagenomics service is an automated pipeline for the analysis
and archiving of metagenomic data that aims to provide insights into the
phylogenetic diversity as well as the functional and metabolic potential
of a sample. You can freely browse all the public data in the repository.
