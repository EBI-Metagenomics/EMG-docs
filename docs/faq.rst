How do I run a BLAST search against the metagenomics datasets?
--------------------------------------------------------------

We don't offer BLAST searches against our metagenomic data sets via the web site. We do not have the resources to offer this service, owing to the size of the data. You would have to download the data and index it for BLAST searching yourself. We do provide scripts for bulk downloading the results files. See the `instructions <https://github.com/ProteinsWebTeam/ebi-metagenomics/wiki/Downloading-results-programmatically>`_.

What kind of data does the service accept?
------------------------------------------

EBI Metagenomics accepts sequencing data from a range of platforms, including Roche 454, Illumina and Ion Torrent. In addition to analysis of whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequenced metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples, it also provides analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon data.

How do I use the comparison tool to compare taxonomies?
-------------------------------------------------------

The current version of the comparison tool only permits comparision of the GO content for runs from the same project. We are working on extending the functionality of the tool to address these issues.
However, please look at the files on the 'Analysis summary' tab on each project's page. They summarize the feature counts across the runs and provide an alternative way to identify patterns.

Which tools do you use for analysing data?
------------------------------------------

Please see the `pipeline` page.


How can I request that my data are re-analyzed with a different version of the pipeline?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We do not automatically re-analyse data with newer pipeline versions when these are released. However, if you would like us to do this, please send your request to us at metagenomics-help@ebi.ac.uk. Once this has been done, the website will show results from both versions of the results.
