How do I run a BLAST search against the metagenomics datasets?
--------------------------------------------------------------

We don't offer BLAST searches against our metagenomic data sets via the web site. We do not have the resources to offer this service, owing to the size of the data. You would have to download the data and index it for BLAST searching yourself. We do provide scripts for bulk downloading the results files. See the `instructions <https://github.com/ProteinsWebTeam/ebi-metagenomics/wiki/Downloading-results-programmatically>`_.

What kind of data does the service accept?
------------------------------------------

EBI Metagenomics accepts sequencing data from a range of platforms, including Roche 454, Illumina and Ion Torrent. In addition to analysis of whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequenced metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples, it also provides analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon data.
