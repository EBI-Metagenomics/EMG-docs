The MGnify service
----------------------------

MGnify is a freely available hub for the analysis and exploration of :term:`metagenomic`, :term:`metatranscriptomic`, :term:`amplicon` and :term:`assembly` data. The resource provides rich functional and taxonomic analyses of user-submitted sequences, as well as analysis of publicly available metagenomic datasets held within the European Nucleotide Archive (`ENA <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena>`_). The MGnify resource was previously known as EBI Metagenomics, but was re-branded in 2018 to reflect its growing remit.

What does MGnify offer
--------------------------------
**Powerful analysis**
   MGnify offers multiple analysis pipelines that are tailored according to input data (amplicon, raw read or assembly), providing (where appropriate) detailed taxonomic and functional analysis of microbiome sequence data.
**Access to an extensive selection of analysed data**
   MGnify houses a vast repository of analysed microbiome datasets, processed using standardized pipelines and workflows, allowing analyses to be placed in context with other studies from similar environments.
**Programmatic access to analysed data**
    In addition to visualisations available from the website and downloadable results files, MGnify analyses can be queried and retrieved via a RESTful API, giving full programmatic access to the data.
**Archiving of user-submitted data**
    Through partnership with the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), user-submitted sequence data and metadata is archived. Accession numbers are supplied as part of this process, which is a prerequisite for publication in many journals.
**Standards-compliant data**
    Submission tools help ensure sequence data and metadata comply with ENA data schemes and the Genomic Standards Consortium (`GSC <https://press3.mcs.anl.gov/gensc/>`_) metadata guidelines, allowing harmonisation of analysis efforts across the wider genomics community.
