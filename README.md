# Developing the documentation
Check out this repository.

You can use `sphinx-autobuild` to watch the `docs/` folder for changes as you save files, rebuild the documentation, and serve it with a local web server.

```shell
# (optionally set up a virtual environment or conda environment)

pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
sphinx-autobuild docs docs/_build/html
```

Browse to [the local webserver](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

The [Sphinx RST Documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) is a good place to start if you are not familiar with RST syntax.
